## Strategy Change Notes

- Effective target session 2026-10-12: approved Crypto AUM trial increases from $3,000 to $4,000 (+33.33%); unchanged sleeve weights, caps and legacy daily SPY beta. Review on 2026-11-12; no automatic increase to $5,000 or rollback.
- Keep AUM migration turnover and costs separate from signal changes; use actual prior shares and confirmed fills. Cash account NAV is not the allocated strategy AUM.
- Effective with the 2026-09-08 target, separate-account AUM increased from $2,000 to $3,000.
- Added the HG carry + NG power shared sleeve at 30%; allocation changed from Platforms/BTC/ETH = 30%/35%/35% to Platforms/BTC/ETH/HG+NG = 20%/30%/20%/30%.
- The $3,000 AUM keeps the original three sleeves' aggregate nominal budget near its prior level: $3,000 x 70% = $2,100 versus the former $2,000 budget. The incremental capital primarily reserves capacity for the new sleeve when its signal is active.
- On the 2026-09-04 signal date the HG+NG sleeve signal is zero; the 2026-09-08 stock target therefore reflects only the active legacy sleeves and integer rounding.

## Execution Notes

- This package belongs to the separate Crypto IB account; never net its SPY hedge with CL/Metals.
- Execute stocks first, then submit the single SPY hedge after confirmed stock fills.
- The SPY child in orders.csv follows post-child integer stock shares; the full continuous hedge remains in targets.csv.
- At $3,000 AUM one SPY share is roughly 25% NAV, so integer hedge rounding is material.
- This is SPY-only hedging. A BTC ETF hedge is not enabled or implied.

## Beta method for 2026-10-22 — as-of 2026-10-21

Continues the operator's 2026-10-09 decision to retain legacy daily beta. Legacy daily-beta method is selected for this session pending further research. Cached-beta targets are comparison-only, not broker instructions. Both methods used identical as-of inventories; stock targets and orders matched. Previous production files were backed up before publication. Cached comparison: /var/folders/g9/s0dqxvt557l2gr1n1d9z_r7m0000gn/T/comm-ls-beta-2026-10-22-r50itokr/cached/targets-crypto/2026-10-22. Agriculture's existing component-specific cached beta is unchanged.

## Approved allocation changes — effective 2026-10-12

Metals AUM remains $5,000: gap 15%, accel 20%, SCO-vol 25%, copper 10%, miners 25%; alloys remains suspended with 5% cash. Crypto separate-account AUM is $4,000 (+33.33% vs $3,000), review on 2026-11-12 with no automatic increase or rollback. CL $15,000 and Agriculture $2,000 are unchanged; main AUM remains $22,000. Legacy daily beta remains the live method; allocation migration turnover is not a signal change. Use confirmed fills for ETF orders and attribution. See docs/live_allocation_change_2026-10-12.md.
