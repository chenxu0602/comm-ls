## Strategy Change Notes

- Effective with the 2026-09-08 target, separate-account AUM increased from $2,000 to $3,000.
- Added the HG carry + NG power shared sleeve at 30%; allocation changed from Platforms/BTC/ETH = 30%/35%/35% to Platforms/BTC/ETH/HG+NG = 20%/30%/20%/30%.
- The $3,000 AUM keeps the original three sleeves' aggregate nominal budget near its prior level: $3,000 x 70% = $2,100 versus the former $2,000 budget. The incremental capital primarily reserves capacity for the new sleeve when its signal is active.
- On the 2026-09-04 signal date the HG+NG sleeve signal is zero; the 2026-09-08 stock target therefore reflects only the active legacy sleeves and integer rounding.

## Execution Notes

- This package belongs to the separate Crypto IB account; never net its SPY hedge with CL/Metals.
- Execute stocks first, then submit the single SPY hedge after confirmed stock fills.
- The SPY child in orders.csv follows post-child integer stock shares; the full continuous hedge remains in targets.csv.
- At $3,000 AUM one SPY share is roughly 25% NAV, so integer hedge rounding is material.
- This is SPY-only hedging. A BTC ETF hedge is not enabled or implied.
